# Fatigue Monitoring System (FaMS)

The FaMS component detects possible psychological (e.g., loss of attention,
mental fatigue) or physical (e.g., tiredness) discomfort or harmful situations
for a worker. The situations identified by this component can be targeted by
other modules to trigger short term intervention, i.e., intervention that can be
executed to support a specific worker during the current working shift. Examples
of possible interventions include:

- providing visual support by highlighting which component is the next one to
  assemble, or where to insert a connector;

- increasing the support provided by the exoskeleton;

- taking a break;

- shut-down all information.
